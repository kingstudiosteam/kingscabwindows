# The King's Cab - Development Session Notes

## Project Overview
**Plugin Name**: The King's Cab  
**Developer**: King Studios  
**Type**: VST3/AU Impulse Response Loader  
**Target**: Professional guitar cabinet simulation  

## Current Status - End of Session

### ✅ **Completed Features**
- [x] Complete JUCE 7 C++ plugin implementation
- [x] VST3 and AU plugin formats
- [x] Professional CMake build system
- [x] 6 IR slots with individual controls
- [x] Master gain and dry/IR mix controls
- [x] Solo, mute, phase invert per slot
- [x] True cabinet simulation (IRs replace dry signal)
- [x] Dedicated to KINGS CAB IR collection (`/Users/justinmitchell/Desktop/KINGS CAB`)
- [x] Removed redundant folder browser
- [x] Compact interface design (840x760)
- [x] Professional 3D/shiny UI styling
- [x] Builds and installs successfully

### ❌ **Critical Issue - LAYOUT OVERLAP**
**PROBLEM**: IR slots are still overlapping the master controls despite multiple layout fixes.

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. Increased master controls height from 100px to 120px
2. Added 30px clear separation spacing
3. Added 10px padding around master controls
4. Increased window height from 720px to 760px
5. Improved layout calculation logic

**Root Cause**: The layout calculation in `PluginEditor::resized()` is not properly accounting for component positioning.

## Tomorrow's Priority Tasks

### 🔥 **CRITICAL - Fix Layout Overlap**
1. **Debug layout calculations** in `src/PluginEditor.cpp::resized()`
2. **Add debug output** to verify bounds calculations
3. **Test step-by-step positioning** of each component
4. **Consider alternative layout approach** (absolute positioning vs relative)

### 🎯 **Secondary Tasks**
1. **Test IR loading functionality** - verify dropdowns populate
2. **Verify audio processing** - ensure IRs actually load and process
3. **Test in Logic Pro** with actual guitar signal
4. **Polish UI spacing** and professional appearance

### Layout Constants (Current)
```cpp
kWindowWidth = 840
kWindowHeight = 760
kHeaderHeight = 80
kMasterControlsHeight = 120  // Increased from 100
kFooterHeight = 40
kSlotSpacing = 12
```

### Key Code Location
**File**: `src/PluginEditor.cpp`  
**Method**: `TheKingsCabAudioProcessorEditor::resized()`  
**Lines**: ~150-180 (layout calculation logic)

## User Feedback
- "they are still on top and covering the top portion of the plugin"
- "fix it . i want this professional. your a master C++ coder !"
- Interface must be **professional grade** quality

## Build Commands
```bash
cd /Users/justinmitchell/cursorfiles/cursorfiles/build
make -j4 && make install
```

## Session Result
- **Plugin builds and installs successfully**
- **Core functionality implemented**
- **Layout overlap remains CRITICAL BLOCKER**
- **Ready for focused debugging session tomorrow**

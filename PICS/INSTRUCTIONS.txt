FREDDY FOLDER - FREDMAN MIC SETUP WITH 2 57S

MIC BLENDS - In the microphone blend folder you will see numbers 0 through 100 and that just means that "0" being the microphone on the left and "100" being the microphone on the right
is just blends of those two microphones.
So for instance, 50 would be a 50-50 percent blend of the two microphones.
You can mix and match any IR with any other IR and they will be phase coherent.


SINGLE MICS - For the single microphones, you will see 25 through 75 and this just means the left and right parameters on the DynaMount.
50 is center cone so 25 is left and 75 is right so you can find your spot. All of these IRs are phase coherent for blending.


CUSTOM BLENDS - The custom blend folder is just something that I made to get you started faster. You can use these IRs to also blend with single microphones from any folder as well.
